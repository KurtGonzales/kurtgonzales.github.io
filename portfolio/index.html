                <p class="p1">
                    The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500
                    companies has allowed me to developer a skillset that helps me in
                    not just development, but in every aspect of any business.
                    <br /><br />
                    I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's
                    largest communities teaching young minds about how to sell yourself
                    as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <p>
                    As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's
                    holding you back is youself.
                    <br /><br />
                    A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.
                    <br /><br />
                    "How big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn't fail?" You've
                    already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's time
                    to elevate your skills and become a leader in something you're
                    passionate about.
                    <br /><br />
                    I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your
                    company.
